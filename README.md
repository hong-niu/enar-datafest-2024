# ENAR-Datafest-2024

Entry for the 2024 ENAR Datafest. 

## Dependencies 

The main dependencies for this project are LLaMA-Factory (https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), used for the fine-tuning of LLM models, as well as the scikit-learn package to perform traditional 

## Data Pre-processing

The core data comes from the aggregated NHANES survey data from the CardioStatsUSA package (https://github.com/jhs-hwg/cardioStatsUSA/tree/main). From this data, we restricted our analysis to just respondents with confirmed hypertension. Further pre-processing of the final tabular dataset includes converting into natural language input/output prompts for the supervised LLM fine-tuning. 

## Fine-Tuning (for Report)


## Colab 
For ease of use, we prepared a completely self-contained Colab notebook with a demonstration of loading LLM models using LLaMA-Factory
